# personal-quant-platform
This is a personal quantitative trading software I’m developing.   It’s still simple, but I want to use it to learn about quant investing and programming.  It helps me collect data, filter stocks, and backtest strategies.   I hope to improve it step by step!  If you also like quant trading, feel free to follow me and share ideas!
